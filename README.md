# React Todo

For this tutorial we'll be following along with a Guide from Mozilla:

[Getting started with React](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started)

I'm going to walk us through creating the app, but I wanted you to have the guide that we'll be working from. It is typical as a software developer for you to follow a guide like this to learn a new framework and get familiar with a new tool. These are usually written with pros in mind, so I'll help fill in some blanks and give you some tips on things I would change.
